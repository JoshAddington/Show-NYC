### Show NYC

The idea for this project was finding a way to increase awareness and
user interaction with the [MTA On-The-Go kiosks](http://www.mta.info/news-new-york-city-transit-go-kiosk/2014/11/05/mta-go-network-offers-customers-date-info-clear-and) that
[Control Group](http://www.controlgroup.com/) designed, and developed
throughout the NYC MTA Subway system.
